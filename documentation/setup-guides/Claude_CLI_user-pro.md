# CLI-First Development System with Environment-First Progress Visualization

After analyzing your requirements and incorporating best practices from tools like Loveable and Replit, I've created an enhanced system specifically designed for CLI-based development tools. This system prioritizes rapid environment initialization, continuous progress visualization, and incremental development that maintains a runnable state at all times.

## I. CLI-First Development Philosophy

### A. Environment-First Principles
```markdown
## Environment-First Development Principles
### Immediate Environment Activation
- Priority #1: Get the development environment running ASAP
- Every task must start with environment verification
- Environment health is the primary progress indicator
- All development happens in a live, running context

### Continuous Progress Visualization
- Progress is measured by visible, working functionality
- Every task completion must result in a runnable state
- Implement "vertical slices" that demonstrate value
- Use the environment itself as the progress dashboard
```

### B. CLI-Optimized Workflow
```markdown
## CLI-Optimized Development Workflow
### Command-Centric Interaction
- All actions initiated through clear CLI commands
- Commands follow consistent verb-noun pattern
- Each command provides immediate, visible feedback
- Progress visualization integrated into command output

### Incremental Enhancement Cycles
1. Initialize environment (immediate feedback)
2. Establish framework structure (visible organization)
3. Implement core functionality (working features)
4. Enhance incrementally (measurable progress)
```

## II. Enhanced System Architecture

### A. Environment-First Task Structure
```markdown
## Enhanced Task Structure for CLI Development
### Task ID: [T001] - [Brief Task Name]
#### Environment Requirements
- Prerequisites: [list of environment needs]
- Startup command: [command to run environment]
- Health check: [how to verify environment is running]
- Progress indicators: [what shows this task is complete]

#### CLI Integration
- Command: [claude-cli task:T001]
- Visualization: [how progress is shown]
- Validation: [how to verify completion]
- Next steps: [what to run after completion]
```

### B. Progress Visualization Framework
```markdown
## Progress Visualization Framework
### Environment Status Dashboard
```bash
# CLI command to show environment status
claude-cli status

# Example output
Environment: RUNNING ✓
Framework: EXPRESS (v4.18.2) ✓
Database: SQLITE (connected) ✓
Tests: 15 passing, 0 failing ✓
Last Task: T005 (User Authentication) ✓
Next Task: T006 (User Profile)
```

### Task Progress Indicators
```bash
# CLI command to show task progress
claude-cli progress --task T006

# Example output
Task T006: User Profile
Status: IN_PROGRESS (65%)
Steps:
  [✓] Backend API endpoints
  [✓] Database schema
  [✓] Basic frontend components
  [→] Profile image upload
  [ ] Profile editing
  [ ] Profile viewing
Environment: RUNNING ✓
```

## III. Enhanced Implementation Process

### A. Phase 1: Environment Initialization (Immediate)
```markdown
## Task T001: Immediate Environment Setup

- Visualization: Real-time installation and startup logs
- Validation: Automatic health check after startup
- Next steps: claude-cli task:T002

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Given developer runs claude-cli setup
- When installation completes
- Then environment is automatically started and verified
- And success message with next steps is displayed
```

### B. Phase 2: Framework Structure (Visible Organization)
```markdown
## Task T002: Framework Structure Establishment
### Priority: P0 (Framework Critical)
### Environment Requirements
- Build on running environment from T001
- No environment restart required
- Health check: Framework structure visible in filesystem
- Progress indicators: Directory structure created, basic routing working

### CLI Integration
- Command: claude-cli framework
- Visualization: Directory structure creation, file generation logs
- Validation: Filesystem check, basic route testing

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Given running environment from T001
- When developer runs claude-cli framework
- Then project structure is created without restarting environment
- And basic framework routes are accessible
```

### C. Phase 3: Core Functionality (Working Features)
```markdown
## Task T003: Core Functionality Implementation
### Priority: P0 (Core Critical)
### Environment Requirements
- Build on framework from T002
- Hot-reload enabled for immediate feedback
- Health check: Core features responding to requests
- Progress indicators: Core endpoints working, basic UI functional

### CLI Integration

## VI. Enhanced Task Execution Framework

### A. Task Execution with Environment Preservation
```markdown
## Task Execution Framework
### Environment-First Execution
1. Verify environment is running before starting task
2. Execute task without stopping environment if possible
3. Use hot-reload capabilities for immediate feedback
4. Validate task completion while environment is running
5. Provide clear next steps that maintain environment state

### Progress Visualization During Execution
```bash
# Example task execution output
$ claude-cli task:T005

Executing Task T005: User Authentication
Environment Status: RUNNING ✓
Step 1/5: Setting up authentication middleware... ✓
Step 2/5: Creating login endpoint... ✓
Step 3/5: Implementing session management... ✓
Step 4/5: Adding authentication UI components... ✓
Step 5/5: Testing authentication flow... ✓

Task T005 completed successfully!
Environment: RUNNING ✓
Next Step: claude-cli task:T006
Preview: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
```

### B. Self-Healing with Environment Preservation
```markdown
## Self-Healing with Environment Continuity
### Environment-Preserving Recovery
1. Detect issues without stopping environment
2. Attempt fixes while environment is running
3. Use feature flags for safe changes
4. Rollback mechanisms that preserve environment state
5. Recovery visualization that shows progress

### Example Self-Healing Process
```bash
$ claude-cli task:T007

Executing Task T007: User Profile
Environment Status: RUNNING ✓
Step 1/4: Creating profile schema... ✓
Step 2/4: Implementing profile API... ✗ Error: Database migration failed

Attempting self-healing...
- Detected missing database column
- Applying hot-fix migration... ✓
- Verifying fix... ✓

Continuing with task...
Step 3/4: Creating profile components... ✓
Step 4/4: Testing profile functionality... ✓

Task T007 completed with self-healing!
Environment: RUNNING ✓
```

## VII. Integration with Existing CLI Tools
