# 🧪 Visual Analysis System - User Testing Guide

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Launch Test Environment
```bash
cd /workspace
./projects/shared/scripts/start-test-server.sh
```
**Expected**: Server starts at http://localhost:8080

### Step 2: Open Standalone App
Navigate to: **http://localhost:8080/projects/image-analysis/image-analysis-app.html**

### Step 3: Test Basic Functionality
1. **Click "Choose Image"** or drag a fantasy character image
2. **Click "Analyze Character Essence"**  
3. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for AI analysis
4. **Review the 6-part essence analysis** results
5. **Try "Export Analysis"** to download JSON

**✅ Success Criteria**: 
- Image uploads successfully
- Analysis completes (AI or fallback)
- Results display with character essence
- Export works

## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Scenario A: AI Analysis (Online)
**Goal**: Test full OpenRouter integration

**Steps**:
1. Upload a clear fantasy character image (JPG/PNG)
2. Enable debug mode (🐛 button top-right)
3. Click "Analyze Character Essence"
4. Monitor debug console for API calls
5. Verify results show detailed analysis

**Expected Results**:
- Progress bar shows real progress
- Debug shows "OpenRouter API call..."
- Analysis has rich, specific details
- All 6 essence components populated
- Technical specs include colors/materials

### Scenario B: Fallback Analysis (Offline)
**Goal**: Test system resilience

**Steps**:
1. Disconnect internet or wait for API to fail
2. Upload any character image
3. Click "Analyze Character Essence"
4. Observe fallback system activation

**Expected Results**:
- System gracefully handles API failure
- Debug shows "using fallback"
- Analysis still generates meaningful content
- All UI elements work normally

### Scenario C: Multiple Image Types
**Goal**: Test format compatibility

**Test Images**:
- JPG character portrait
- PNG character with transparency
- Large image (>2MB)
- Small image (<100KB)
- WebP format (if available)

**Expected Results**:
- All formats upload successfully
- Large images process (may take longer)
- Small images process quickly
- WebP works if browser supports it

## Advanced Testing (Database Integration)

### Prerequisites
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor or psql:
\i /workspace/projects/worldbuilding-codex/core/database-extensions.sql
\i /workspace/projects/shared/database/test-database-schema.sql
```

### Integrated Codex Testing
1. Open: **http://localhost:8080/projects/worldbuilding-codex/core/codex-viewer-v4.html**
2. Click "✨ Analyze Image" button
3. Upload character image in modal
4. Wait for analysis completion
5. Click "🆕 Create New Character"
6. Enter character name and submit
7. Verify character appears in grid with ✨ icon
