# Server Stability Analysis

## Issue Summary
The Vite development server starts successfully but becomes unresponsive after page reloads, requiring manual restart.

## Analysis Steps Performed

### 1. Initial Diagnosis
- Checked process status: `ps aux | grep -E "(node|npm|dev)"`
- Found multiple defunct/zombie processes
- Verified TCP connections via `/proc/net/tcp`
- Port 8080 (hex: 1F90) not consistently listening

### 2. Network Investigation
- Tested server response: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/`
- Connection failures (HTTP 000 responses)
- TCP state analysis showed inconsistent binding

### 3. Configuration Review
- Examined `vite.config.ts`:
  - Host: `0.0.0.0` (correct)
  - Port: `8080` (correct)
  - HMR configuration present
  - Polling enabled for Docker compatibility

### 4. Resolution Attempts
- Killed zombie processes: `pkill -f "npm run dev"`
- Restarted with explicit binding: `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
- Verified successful startup with TCP connection monitoring

## Root Cause Hypothesis
- **Process Management**: Vite/Node.js processes not terminating cleanly
- **Container Environment**: Docker networking may cause binding issues
- **HMR Conflicts**: Hot Module Replacement may interfere with server stability

## Recommended Investigation Steps
1. **Monitor Process Lifecycle**: Track Vite process behavior during reloads
2. **Container Networking**: Investigate Docker port mapping stability
3. **HMR Configuration**: Test with HMR disabled to isolate the issue
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Check memory/CPU usage during crashes
5. **Log Analysis**: Enable verbose Vite logging to capture failure points

## Temporary Workaround
Restart server manually when unresponsive:
```bash
pkill -f "npm run dev" || true
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Status
- **Immediate**: Server operational after manual restart
- **Long-term**: Requires stability investigation when time permits
